the character rigged is a generic cartoon man.
created the joints, duplicated and set up ik/fk/rk system.
added controls and constraints.
rig uses ik/fk controls with a switch built into the rk system.
kept breaking small things, went back to the videos again, watched them till i realized my mistake, and fixed it.
